            <h2>hire new electrician</h2>
            <p>
              The main job of a homeowner is to keep the major systems in their
              residence working efficiently. While this may sound fairly simple,
              it is anything but. Among the most important parts of any home is
              the electrical system. Without a properly working electrical
              system, the various appliances and electronics a homeowner depends
              on will not work. There will come a time when the electrical
              system in a home will need repair. Below are some of the things a
              homeowner will need to consider when trying to hire the right
              electrician for their repair needs.
            </p>

            <h2>are they a licensed electrician</h2>
            <p>
              The first thing you will have to think about when trying to hire
              the right electrician is the type of licenses they have. There are
              two basic types of licenses in the electric world; a journeyman
              license and a master electrician license. A journeyman license is
              basically like a driver’s permit, where the master electrician is
              the actual driver’s licenses. Ideally, you will want to find a
              professional with a master electrician’s license due to the
              knowledge they will have.

            <h2>can they provide onsite estimate</h2>
            <p>
              For most homeowners, finding electricians who can get their
              repairs done quickly without charging too much is important. The
              best way for you to figure out what an electrician can offer is by
              getting them to give an onsite estimate. Most electricians will
              have no problem giving these types of estimates for free. During
              this estimate, you will need to ask any questions that you may
              have to set your mind at ease about hiring a particular company.
              Be sure to ask about the cost of the repairs needed and how long
              the electrician thinks they will take to complete.
            </p>

            <h2>what type of work do they commonly perform</h2>
            <p>
              When attempting to hire the right electricians, you will also need
              to consider the type of repairs they commonly perform. Finding an
              electrician with a good deal of experience in residential repairs
              will help to ensure the job at hand will be performed the right
              way. Taking the time to research a prospective electrician will
              allow you to find out more about their work history.
