            <h2>does your home need electrical upgrades</h2>
            <p>
              Does your home need electrical outlet upgrades? Do you know? If
              not, it may be wise to ask a professional. However, it may also be
              enough just for you to see what types of upgrades are possible.
              When you know what options you have, you can make the best
              decision regarding if these are needed for your home.

            <h2>led night light outlets</h2>
            <p>
              An LED night light outlet isn’t really new; however, it is a
              popular option for many homes – especially those with small
              children or seniors. This is a plug-and-play replacement for the
              traditional, plug-in night-lights and the use of a standard
              outlet. This type of outlet can be installed in just a few seconds
              and it doesn’t require any type of batteries or wires. In fact,
              during the day, these devices look like a standard outlet cover,
              and at night, they provide ambient lighting. Also, these can save
              you money, as they offer a 20-year life expectancy.

            <h2>USB outlets</h2>
            <p>
              There are a wide array of devices that require a USB block to
              charge. If you only have the cord, this can be quite frustrating.
              However, now you can have an electric outlet installed that
              features a USB port – built-in. These are alongside the two
              traditional electrical plug-in spaces that outlets come with. Keep
              in mind, with this outlet upgrade, you are going to have to get
              into the wiring. As a result, you want to make sure you hire a
              licensed electrician to handle this for you. The installation of
              USB outlets is growing because they help to reduce the total
              number of extension cords needed, while providing you with instant
              access to a port for all your USB charged devices.

            <h2>recessed outlets</h2>
            <p>
              Modern, recessed outlet hardware is essentially a faceplate that
              is embedded into your wall. Recessed outlets help to prevent any
              connectors or plugs from protruding past the surface of your wall.
              This is a more aesthetically pleasing option and offers increased
              safety against electrocution. It’s recommended that you install
              recessed outlets behind your flat-mounted TV screens, behind your
              furniture, in the kitchen and bathrooms and anywhere else where
              putting an electrical outlet may create some type of danger.
